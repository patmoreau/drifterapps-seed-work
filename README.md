This library is a collections of utility classes, mostly abstract, that I use with various clients for which as a
TechLead I help their teams build robust software.

This usually includes a variety of APIs using [ASP.NET](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/apps/aspnet) and
frontend [Angular](https://angular.io/) applications.

I tone my craft by developing a budgeting application [Holefeeder](https://github.com/patmoreau/Holefeeder) where I
constantly refactor it in order to acquired new knowledge and perfecting my skills.
